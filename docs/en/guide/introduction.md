# Why Vim?

Vim is a text editor released by Bram Moolenaar in 1991, evolved from the original vi.

## Speed and Efficiency
Vim's core philosophy is: **Your fingers should never leave the home row**. Through modal editing, you can perform complex modifications with extremely short key combinations.

## Ubiquity
Whether it's a remote server connection (SSH) or modern IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains), you can find Vim emulation or plugins everywhere.

## Highly Customizable
Through Vimscript or Lua (Neovim), you can build Vim to fit your personal workflow perfectly.
